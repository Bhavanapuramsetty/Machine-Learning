Overview

This project focuses on enhancing academic advising in higher education by leveraging data mining techniques, specifically K-Means clustering and FP-Growth algorithms. The goal is to provide personalized course recommendations by analyzing student demographic and academic performance data. The approach segments students into distinct clusters based on their attributes and identifies association rules to guide course selection, ultimately improving academic outcomes.

Repository Contents

DM-Project-Group-9-Report.docx: The final project report detailing the methodology, results, and findings.

Dataset: Sourced from Kaggle, containing anonymized high school student data (academic scores, demographics, etc.).

Code: Python scripts used for data preprocessing, K-Means clustering, FP-Growth algorithm implementation, and result visualization (not included in the document but referenced as using pandas, scikit-learn, and mlxtend libraries).

Prerequisites

To replicate or extend the analysis, ensure the following are installed:

Python 3.x

Libraries: pandas, scikit-learn, mlxtend, matplotlib

Dataset: Download from the provided Kaggle link

Methodology

Data Preprocessing:

Handled missing values using median (numerical) and mode (categorical).

Normalized numerical data with StandardScaler.

Applied one-hot encoding for categorical variables.

K-Means Clustering:

Determined optimal clusters (k=4) using the elbow method.

Segmented students based on academic and demographic features.

FP-Growth Algorithm:

Identified association rules within clusters with minimum support (0.05) and confidence (0.2).

Evaluation:

Used silhouette score for clustering quality.

Assessed association rules with support, confidence, and lift metrics.

Key Findings





Clustering: Four student clusters identified:





Cluster 0: High-achieving students, recommended for advanced courses.



Cluster 1: Students needing math support, suggested for remedial workshops.



Cluster 2: Balanced performers, encouraged for advanced courses in strong areas.



Cluster 3: Humanities-strong students, needing math support.



Association Rules: Highlighted relationships between demographic/academic factors and course success, though no high-lift rules were found, suggesting weak correlations or need for threshold adjustment.



Feedback: Cluster-based recommendations received positive feedback (scores 3.8â€“4.5), with suggestions for more personalized and adaptive advising.

Usage





Clone the repository (if available) or download the report and dataset.



Install required Python libraries: pip install pandas scikit-learn mlxtend matplotlib.



Preprocess the dataset as described in the report.



Run K-Means and FP-Growth scripts to replicate clustering and rule mining.



Visualize results using provided plot descriptions (e.g., elbow plot, scatter plots, heatmaps).

Limitations





Limited dataset scope (high school students from few institutions).



Excludes dynamic factors like student motivation or teaching quality.

Future Work





Expand dataset diversity.



Incorporate additional variables (e.g., psychological factors).



Implement real-time feedback loops for adaptive advising.
